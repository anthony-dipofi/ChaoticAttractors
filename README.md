# ChaoticAttractors


A simple library to simulate the trajectories of a various chaotic dynamical systems.
# Examples
Rabinovichâ€“Fabrikant equations

```
from attractors import RabFab_attractor
RabFab_attractor(init = (-1,0,0.5), a = 1.1, g = 0.87, speed = 0.001, steps = 150000)
```

Rossler Attractor

```
from attractors import Rossler_attractor
Rossler_attractor(init = (0.1,0.1,0.1), a = 0.35, b = 0.5, c = 12, speed = 0.01, steps = 15000)
```

Lorenz Attractor

```
from attractors import Lorenz_attractor
Lorenz_attractor(init = (10,10,10), sigma = 10, rho = 28, beta = 8/3, speed = 0.001, steps = 30000)
```
